## Island Perimeter

This is a coding interview question that asks you to find the perimeter of an island in a 2D grid. An island is a group of connected 1s surrounded by 0s. The perimeter of an island is the sum of the lengths of its edges.

### Solution

The following is a solution to the island perimeter problem in Python.

```python
def island_perimeter(grid):
  """
  Finds the perimeter of an island in a 2D grid.

  Parameters:
    grid: A 2D list of integers, where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

  Returns:
    The perimeter of the island.
  """

  # Initialize the perimeter.
  perimeter = 0

  # Iterate over the grid, adding 1 to the perimeter for each edge of the island.
  for i in range(len(grid)):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
      if grid[i][j] == 1:
        # Check if the cell is on the edge of the grid.
        if i == 0 or grid[i - 1][j] == 0:
          perimeter += 1
        if j == 0 or grid[i][j - 1] == 0:
          perimeter += 1
        if i == len(grid) - 1 or grid[i + 1][j] == 0:
          perimeter += 1
        if j == len(grid[0]) - 1 or grid[i][j + 1] == 0:
          perimeter += 1

  return perimeter
```

### Thought Process

The first step in solving this problem is to identify the edges of the island. An edge is a cell that is adjacent to a cell that is not part of the island. We can find the edges of the island by iterating over the grid and checking each cell. If a cell is part of the island, we check its adjacent cells. If any of the adjacent cells are not part of the island, then the cell is an edge.

Once we have identified the edges of the island, we can calculate the perimeter by summing the lengths of the edges. The length of an edge is the number of cells that are part of the edge.

### Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of cells in the grid. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1).
